    "## Now we see how we can do our first encryption of polynomial\n",
    "The way to do it is first to compute the polynomial in the unencrypted domain for a given r(a scalar that is used to compute the value of the polynomial, e.g. p(r)), then encrypt this result using the method described above.\n",
    "Then the prover computes it in the encrypted domain, returns it to the verifier.\n",
    "Finally, the Verifier verifies the 2 values match.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that has been a little complicated to integrate is how to prove equality in the encrypted domain.\n",
    "So, what do we mean by encrypted domain to start with?\n",
    "We mean that arithmetic operations have a different meaning than in the unencryted domain (i.e. the normal way \n",
    "we perform arithmetic)\n",
    "\n",
    "The encrypted domain has elements that are in the form $E(x)=(g^x\\mod p)$, with g and p being chosen primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When 2 encrypted elements are added together, we in fact use a multiplier to compute that addition. This is because if we have $E(a)=(g^a \\mod p), E(b)=(g^b \\mod p)$ as elements and we add them in the unencrypted domain we get $E(a+b) \\equiv (g^{a+b} \\mod p) \\equiv (g^a * g^b \\mod p) \\equiv (g^a \\mod p) * (g^b \\mod p) \\equiv (E(a) * E(b))$\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the unencrypted domain $1 + 5 = 6$, if we want to compute it in the encrypted domain with $g=3, p=7$. \n",
    "We start by computing 6 in the encrypted domain: $E(6) = 3^6 \\mod 7 = 1$\n",
    "Then we compute $E(1) * E(5) = (3^5 \\mod 7) * (3^1 \\mod 7) = 5 * 3 \\mod 7 = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when we multiply 2 encrypted elements what we really are doing is exponentiating them. This is because again we are dealing with exponentiated elements. So let's see what we get when we perform a multiplication in the encrypted domain. $E(a * b) = (g^{a*b} \\mod p) = ((g^a)^b \\mod p)$. Rightly, you may be wondering if the multiplication in the encrypted domain is commutative, if in fact $((g^a)^b \\mod p) = ((g^b)^a \\mod p)$ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example, with a=4 and b=5, and again g=3, p=7. In the unencrypted domain $5 * 4 = 20$, if we then encrypt this value we get $3^{20} \\mod 7 = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to the encrypted domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first equation to check is $((g^a)^b \\mod p)$. So this is $(3^4)^5 \\mod 7 \\equiv (3^4 \\mod 7)^ 5 \\mod 7) \\equiv 4^5 \\mod 7 = 2$ ! success\n",
    "The second equation to check is $((g^b)^a \\mod p)$. So this is $(3^5)^4 \\mod 7 \\equiv (3^5 \\mod 7)^ 4 \\mod 7) \\equiv 5^4 \\mod 7 = 2$ ! success again\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 things that could have made this not true is the fact we use modulo at each step combined with _the power of a power rule_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative number in the encrypted domain is found by calculating the multiplicative modular inverse of that number in the modulo field and is represented by $g^{-1} \\mod p$, which means $g * g^{-1} = 1 (\\mod p )$. And as we have seen above with the power rule of a power rule, we can rewrite $g^{-2} \\mod p$ as $(g^{-1})^2 (\\mod p )$\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance if we want to encrypt -2, we get 4 by virtue of $3^{-2} \\mod 7 \\equiv (3^{-1})^2) \\mod7$. The modular multiplication inverse of 3 is 5 (because $3 * 5 mod 7 = 1$). So we can rewrite that last equation with $5^2 \\mod 7 = 4$. Case solved!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform a division in the encryted domain, we have to use modulo division concept which is also based on the modular inverse but I will not explain it, because we it is not needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is NOT possible have the equivalent of exponentiation of the unencrypted domain in the encrypted one."

    "Well, we can see that the protocol implemented from chapter 3.3.4 has a major weakness, which is that the prover does NOT have to use the encrypted powers, or even a polynomial to provide a valid answer.\n",
    "One could use any possible means to find some arbitrary values $z^p$ and $z^h$ which satisfy equation $z^p = (zh)^{t(s)}$ and provide them to the verifier instead of $g^p$ and $g^h$. For example, for some random r, $zh = g^r$ and $zp = (g^{t(s)})^r$, where $gt(s)$ can be computed from the provided encrypted powers of s. That is why the verifier needs the proof that only supplied encryptions of powers of s were used to calculate gp and gh and nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are going to force the prover to use the encrypted powers by having him perform the same calculations twice, but with encrypted powers $\\alpha$ shifted. Let's explore this concept to understand it and see how it applies here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice chooses a random value $\\alpha$, which she uses to exponentiate a value x that she requires Bob to exponentiate. So, she generates $\\alpha$ (let's say 3) and wants x (let's say it's 2) to be exponentiated. She generates $x' = x^{\\alpha}$ and gives x and x' to Bob. He does not know what $\\alpha$ is. For this example, she gives Bob 2 and $2^3 \\mod 7$\n",
    "\n",
